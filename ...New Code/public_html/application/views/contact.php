        <h1>Who We Are</h1>
        <br>
        
        <p>We are a collection of youth pastors who may have different backgrounds and denominational labels, but we share one common passionâ€¦.Teenagers. We believe that together we can effectively reach and restore a lost generation. 

          We are, The Refuge Youth Center, a nonprofit organization that seeks to provide an emotionally and physically safe environment where teenagers can come participate in events and activities that develop a desire in them to not only better themselves, but the communities around them as well. The Center offers teenagers in the surrounding community with an opportunity to engage in their youthful hobbies (skateboarding, basketball, art, music, dance, drama) and other after school activities. This allows them to be able to develop and foster their creative skills and talents without compromising their safety or their character. The long term goal of the Refuge Youth Center is to empower teenagers by providing a positive peer group and environment, which will then allow them to develop the habits that will help make a positive impact on themselves, their family, friends, and community. </p>

      <h4>Micah Hernandez - Music Director</h4>
      <p>I am Micah Hernandez Co-director of the Music Department at the Refuge Youth Center. I have been involved with the Refuge music department for over 6 years and have grown to love working with music and people more and more. When I started learning music, people use to tell me to stop making noise. Since then, I have learned that being able to listen is just as important in the musical world as is in relationships. I do what I do, because I love being the person who people can count on and be the person who people know that they can go to. It is my passion to see people grow closer to God and closer to each other and I know that music is a great way to make that happen.</p>

      <h4>Josh Carlson - Music Director</h4>
      <p>Music has always been that one thing that can bring people together, it unites different religions, race, and social classes across the globe, the way our Creator designed for us to come together. Music creates the avenue to express oneself very honestly and passionately that many young people desperately long for. In a world where fitting in sometimes doesn't seem possible and where hurt and heartache seem to far outweigh any joy that life could bring, music can be the tool to bring God's Hope to a lost generation. However, with the same intensity that music can bring hope, it can also be just as destructive. My desire for the music department at the refuge is to provide an outlet for youth to grow their God-given talents for expression, to create a safe place where there is enough room for everyone's style and taste. Over time, I want to see the ability for youth at the Refuge to learn an instrument, take lessons, start a band, put on concerts, and even record an album.</p>

      <h4>Stephen Wedlich aka Stevo - Security</h4>
      <p>I'm Stephen. I'm 21 years old and I was born and raised here in Phoenix, Arizona. I have been doing youth ministry for the past seven years. I first came to the refuge when I was fourteen years old and it could not have come at a more perfect time. I was at a point in life where I was on the verge of suicide. I was unhappy with my friends, my family, but more so, I was unhappy with myself. I began searching for acceptance from various peer groups and always came up empty. I came to the refuge and discovered who I am in Christ and who I am created to be. I found true friends and the love of a family. Since then, I have made it a goal to help teenagers discover their identities and help them realize the potential they have as a child of God. I want to help kids find the hope that they thought was lost and help them find themselves safe in the arms of Christ.</p>
